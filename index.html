				<p>What is the Mandela Effect?<br><br>
				One simple way to describe the Mandela Effect is when you are certain that you remember something a certain way, but 
				discovering that it was all wrong. It ties with the theory that we are one of many world or of many universes. The Mandela 
				Effect believes that similar events that have happened in our world happened in ones similar to ours but just slightly different.<br>
				Some people believe that this happens because of time travelers. Other believe it comes from witchcrafts. But science believes it 
				comes from memory inaccuracy but lets forget about science for a moment. And dig deeper into how some people believe the Mandela Effect is taking place.</p>

				<p class="linespace" >Time Travel<br><br>
				Some people believe that there are time travelers who travel through time learning one thing but comeback and realize that its something different, it 
				could be without even knowing it happened: "Let’s say it’s December 1986 and you’re a teenager. You’re aware of turmoil in South Africa, and — in your reality 
				— Nelson Mandela is taking part in another hunger strike where he’s imprisoned. (A side note for those who are looking at patterns related to 2s and 3s: He 
				was prisoner 46664.)One morning, you go through your bedroom door and — in another reality where it’s December 2013 (but you’re only half-awake as you 
				shovel in a quick breakfast, and you don’t notice some odd changes) — your mother tells you the sad news that Nelson Mandela has died. Since your mind is 
				on an upcoming exam, you assume Mandela died from the hunger strike. And then you go back to your bedroom, through the doorway* …and you’re back in 1986.
				That day’s exam (at school) is a disaster. You know you did badly. You scramble to earn some extra credits before school vacation, because you really need 
				a good grade in that class. And, then it’s the holiday season. You forget all about Mandela’s death… until 2010 or so, when a friend says a few people 
				recall Mandela dying in the late 20th century. Suddenly, that memory — which you think is from 1986 — comes flooding back. You know Mandela died in 1986, 
				because your mother said so, and she was never, ever wrong about that kind of thing."(via <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/is-time-travel-part-of-the-mandela-effect/" target="_blank" class="hyperlink1">mandelaeffect.com</a>)</p>

				<p>Changing The Past<br><br>
				Another theory is that there is someone (in another universe) changing our past for self gain. This could be for money, power, etc..</p> <img src="images/handuni.png" width="100%">
